## GNN for maximum cut problem

## Getting started:

    1. Requirements:
        1.1 unix-like OS (tested only on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS)
        1.2 python3.8 or higher

## What functionality is provided:

    1. Generator of regular graphs with weight in [0, 1] range;
    weights are generated from uniform distribution
    
    2. Brute force algorithm for max-cut problem
